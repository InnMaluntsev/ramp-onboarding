## 🔧 Configuration

### Lab Configuration

The main lab configuration is in `src/config.ts`:

```typescript
export const labsConfig: Record<string, LabConfig> = {
  "ramp-onboarding": {
    id: "ramp-onboarding",
    title: "RAMP Onboarding Guide",
    description: "Learn to implement Fireblocks RAMP capabilities...",
    steps: [
      { id: 1, title: "Understanding RAMP & What You'll Build", file: "ramp-onboarding/step1.md" },
      { id: 2, title: "RAMP Knowledge Check", file: "ramp-onboarding/step2.md" },
      { id: 3, title: "Authentication & Signature", file: "ramp-onboarding/step3.md" },
      { id: 4, title: "Build API Responses", file: "ramp-onboarding/step4.md" },
    ]
  }
};
```

### Adding New Quiz Questions

Update quiz questions in the respective components:
- RAMP quiz: `src/app/components/InteractiveQuiz.tsx`
- Auth quiz: `src/app/components/AuthSignatureQuiz.tsx`

## 🎯 Key Features

## 📚 Content Management

### Step Content Files
Step content is stored in markdown files under `public/steps/ramp-onboarding/`:
- `step1.md` - Understanding RAMP & What You'll Build
- `step2.md` - RAMP Knowledge Check
- `step3.md` - Authentication & Signature
- `step4.md` - Build API Responses

### Updating Content
1. Edit the relevant markdown file
2. Run the development server to see changes
3. Build and deploy for production updates

## 🔍 API Integration

The application is designed to work with the Fireblocks Provider Connectivity API v2:

### Core Endpoints
- `GET /capabilities` - Server capabilities
- `GET /accounts` - Account management
- `GET /accounts/{id}/balances` - Balance queries
- `GET /accounts/{id}/ramps` - RAMP operations

### Implementation Examples
See Step 4 for detailed implementation examples and the interactive API builder.

## 🚀 Deployment

### GitHub Pages Deployment
The application supports static export for GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run build
npm run export
```

The output will be in the `out/` directory, ready for deployment.

### Configuration for Deployment
Update `src/config.ts` for your deployment environment:

```typescript
export const generalConfig: GeneralConfig = {
  companyName: "Fireblocks",
  basePath: isDev ? "" : "/your-repo-name", // Update for GitHub Pages
};
```
