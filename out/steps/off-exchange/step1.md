<!-- # Step 1: Understanding Off-Exchange

## What is Off-Exchange?

Fireblocks Off-Exchange is a revolutionary solution that enables traders to execute cryptocurrency trades on centralized exchanges while **keeping their funds protected within a Fireblocks vault**. Unlike traditional exchange trading where assets must be deposited directly with the exchange, Off-Exchange allows traders to retain full custody of their funds in a dedicated **Collateral Vault Account (CVA)**.

## Why Off-Exchange Matters

**Enhanced Security** 🛡️  
Recent events in the cryptocurrency industry have highlighted the risks of leaving assets on exchanges, particularly in cases of insolvency or security breaches. Off-Exchange provides a safer alternative while maintaining full trading capabilities.

**Custody Control** 🔐  
Traders maintain complete ownership and control of their funds while actively engaging in trading. The CVA is controlled by the customer but designed solely to facilitate secure Off-Exchange trading.

**Counterparty Risk Mitigation** ⚖️  
This approach reduces exposure to centralized exchange failures while streamlining fund management. The exchange does not own or control the CVA but has rights over the credit balance for trade settlement.

**Seamless Trading Experience** 🚀  
Execute transactions with confidence knowing assets remain securely stored, accessible only under controlled conditions, and fully protected from external threats.

## Core Architecture

The Off-Exchange system creates a secure bridge between your trading activities and asset custody:
