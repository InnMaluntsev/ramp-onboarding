# Step 4: Advanced Network Link Capabilities (Optional)

## 🔧 Optional Advanced Integration

This step is **optional** and covers advanced Network Link v2 capabilities beyond core RAMP functionality. If you're focused purely on RAMP implementation, you can skip to **Step 5: Build API Responses**.

However, understanding these capabilities can help you offer additional value to your clients and build a more comprehensive financial services platform.

## 🌐 Beyond RAMP: Full Network Link Ecosystem

While RAMP focuses on payment flows, Network Link v2 offers a complete ecosystem of financial capabilities:

### Transfer Capabilities
- **Blockchain Transfers**: Send crypto to external addresses
- **Peer Account Transfers**: Move funds between different providers
- **Internal Transfers**: Manage funds within your platform
- **Fiat Transfers**: Traditional banking and wire transfers

### Trading & Liquidity
- **Order Book Trading**: Professional trading features
- **Liquidity Pools**: Access to institutional liquidity
- **Asset Conversion**: Beyond RAMP's payment focus

### Advanced Features
- **Collateral Management**: Off-exchange trading support
- **Multi-account Structures**: Complex organizational hierarchies
- **Compliance Tools**: Enhanced AML/KYC workflows

## 🎯 When to Consider Advanced Capabilities

Consider implementing additional capabilities if:
- Your clients need comprehensive crypto services
