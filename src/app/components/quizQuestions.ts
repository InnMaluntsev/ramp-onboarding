  // Questions 1-3: Basic concepts (Easy)
  {
    id: 1,
    question: "What is the primary purpose of RAMP in the Fireblocks ecosystem?",
    options: [
      { letter: 'A', text: 'Bridge traditional finance and cryptocurrency for institutional clients' },
      { letter: 'B', text: 'Provide cryptocurrency mining services' },
      { letter: 'C', text: 'Create new blockchain networks' },
      { letter: 'D', text: 'Manage digital wallet security' }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'A',
    explanation: "RAMP (Rapid Asset Movement Protocol) is specifically designed to bridge traditional finance and cryptocurrency, enabling seamless conversion between fiat and digital assets for institutional clients. It focuses on payment flows like on-ramp, off-ramp, and crypto-to-crypto bridging, not mining (B), blockchain creation (C), or wallet security (D).",
    category: 'ramp-basics'
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Which of these is NOT one of the four core RAMP capabilities launched in September 2025?",
    options: [
      { letter: 'A', text: 'Crypto-to-crypto bridging' },
      { letter: 'B', text: 'Provider directory for discovery' },
      { letter: 'C', text: 'Cryptocurrency mining operations' },
      { letter: 'D', text: 'On-ramp (fiat to crypto)' }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: "The four core RAMP capabilities are: On-ramp (D), Off-ramp, Crypto-to-crypto bridging (A), and Provider directory (B). Mining operations (C) are infrastructure activities unrelated to payment processing and asset conversion flows that RAMP handles.",
    category: 'ramp-basics'
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "In RAMP terminology, what does 'Off-Ramp' specifically refer to?",
    options: [
      { letter: 'A', text: 'Converting between different cryptocurrencies' },
      { letter: 'B', text: 'Converting fiat currency to cryptocurrency' },
      { letter: 'C', text: 'Converting cryptocurrency to fiat currency' },
      { letter: 'D', text: 'Transferring crypto between wallets' }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: "Off-ramp specifically means converting cryptocurrency to fiat currency, allowing users to 'exit' the crypto ecosystem into traditional banking. On-ramp (B) is the opposite direction. Cross-chain bridging (A) and wallet transfers (D) don't involve fiat currency conversion.",
    category: 'ramp-basics'
  },

  // Questions 4-6: Intermediate concepts (Medium)
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "What is the key difference between Prefunded and Delivery (DVP) order flows?",
    options: [
      { letter: 'A', text: 'Prefunded is faster but Delivery is more secure' },
      { letter: 'B', text: 'Prefunded requires existing balance, Delivery funds on demand' },
      { letter: 'C', text: 'Prefunded is for crypto only, Delivery is for fiat only' },
      { letter: 'D', text: 'There is no meaningful difference between them' }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: "Prefunded flows use existing account balance for immediate conversion, while Delivery (DVP) flows fund the account on-demand when the order is placed. Both can handle fiat and crypto (C is wrong), speed/security aren't the distinguishing factors (A), and they serve different use cases (D is incorrect).",
    category: 'technical'
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "Which pricing method provides a locked-in conversion rate that must be used before expiration?",
    options: [
      { letter: 'A', text: 'Quote-based pricing' },
      { letter: 'B', text: 'Market-based pricing' },
      { letter: 'C', text: 'Dynamic pricing' },
      { letter: 'D', text: 'Fixed pricing' }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'A',
    explanation: "Quote-based pricing provides a locked-in rate from a pre-generated quote with an expiration time. Market-based pricing (B) uses live rates without locking. 'Dynamic pricing' (C) and 'fixed pricing' (D) aren't standard RAMP terminology - the two official methods are quote-based and market-based.",
    category: 'technical'
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "What are the mandatory API endpoints that ALL RAMP providers must implement?",
    options: [
      { letter: 'A', text: 'GET /accounts/{id}/ramps, POST /accounts/{id}/ramps, GET /accounts/{id}/ramps/{id}' },
      { letter: 'B', text: 'GET /trading/orders, POST /trading/orders, GET /liquidity/quotes' },
      { letter: 'C', text: 'GET /transfers/withdrawals, POST /transfers/deposits, GET /balances' },
      { letter: 'D', text: 'GET /capabilities, GET /accounts, GET /capabilities/assets' }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'D',
    explanation: "All RAMP providers must implement three core mandatory endpoints: GET /capabilities (declare server capabilities), GET /accounts (account management), and GET /capabilities/assets (list supported assets). The other options show optional endpoints that are specific to certain capabilities like RAMP operations, trading, or transfers.",
    category: 'implementation'
  },

  // Questions 7-8: Advanced concepts (Hard)
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "In a multi-asset RAMP implementation supporting the same token across different blockchains, how should asset references be properly structured?",
    options: [
      { letter: 'A', text: 'Use the same assetId for identical tokens regardless of blockchain' },
      { letter: 'B', text: 'Create unique assetIds for each blockchain-token combination with blockchain specified' },
      { letter: 'C', text: 'Use only cryptocurrencySymbol and ignore blockchain differences' },
      { letter: 'D', text: 'Always use contractAddress regardless of blockchain type' }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: "Each blockchain-token combination needs a unique assetId because USDC on Ethereum vs Polygon are technically different assets with different contract addresses and fees. Using the same ID (A) creates confusion, using only symbols (C) loses blockchain context, and contract addresses (D) don't work for all asset types.",
    category: 'technical'
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "What happens when a RAMP order uses market-based pricing during periods of high volatility?",
    options: [
      { letter: 'A', text: 'The order is automatically cancelled for safety' },
      { letter: 'B', text: 'The system switches to quote-based pricing temporarily' },
      { letter: 'C', text: 'The conversion executes at whatever the current market rate is at execution time' },
      { letter: 'D', text: 'The order waits until volatility decreases before executing' }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: "Market-based pricing always executes at the live market rate regardless of volatility - that's the key characteristic distinguishing it from quote-based pricing. The system doesn't automatically cancel (A), switch pricing methods (B), or delay execution (D) - it processes the conversion at the current market conditions.",
    category: 'technical'
  },

  // Questions 9-10: Expert level (Very Hard)
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "What determines the PII (Personally Identifiable Information) requirements for RAMP transactions in terms of originator and beneficiary details?",
    options: [
      { letter: 'A', text: 'Always require both originator and beneficiary details for all transactions' },
      { letter: 'B', text: 'Transaction amount is the sole determining factor for PII requirements' },
      { letter: 'C', text: 'Only beneficiary information is required for regulatory compliance' },
      { letter: 'D', text: 'First-party vs third-party ownership patterns and regulatory requirements' }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'D',
    explanation: "PII requirements depend on transaction ownership and regulatory context. First-party transactions (same entity) need less PII since parties are pre-KYC'd, while third-party transactions require full details for Travel Rule compliance. A blanket requirement (A) is inefficient, amount alone (B) ignores ownership context, and beneficiary-only (C) misses originator compliance needs.",
    category: 'compliance'
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "In the correct sequence for a Prefunded Convert & Withdraw operation, what is the proper order of operations?",
    options: [
      { letter: 'A', text: 'Generate quote → Reserve funds → Convert → Send to destination → Update balances' },
      { letter: 'B', text: 'Send payment instructions → Wait for funds → Convert → Send to destination' },
      { letter: 'C', text: 'Check available balance → Reserve funds → Convert → Send to destination → Update balances' },
      { letter: 'D', text: 'Convert immediately → Check balance → Send to destination' }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: "Prefunded operations start by checking available balance, then reserving funds to prevent double-spending, converting assets, sending to destination, and updating balances. Quote generation (A) isn't always needed for prefunded flows, waiting for funds (B) describes DVP flows, and converting before checking balance (D) risks overdrafts and fails atomicity requirements.",

  }
];

const ADVANCED_RAMP_QUESTIONS: QuizQuestion[] = [
  {
    id: 11,
    question: "When implementing quote-based pricing with late funding in DVP flows, what should happen if the quote expires before payment arrives?",
    options: [
      { letter: 'A', text: 'Execute at the expired quote price anyway' },
      { letter: 'B', text: 'Automatically execute at current market price' },
      { letter: 'C', text: 'Reject the order and return funds, unless customer pre-authorized re-quote' },
      { letter: 'D', text: 'Hold funds indefinitely until customer approves new quote' }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: "For DVP orders with quote-based pricing, late funding results in order rejection and fund return by default. Providers can optionally implement a feature allowing customers to pre-authorize automatic re-quote and execution for late arrivals.",
    category: 'technical'
  },
  {
    id: 12,
    question: "In the RAMP order execution flow, what is the correct sequence for a Prefunded Convert & Withdraw operation?",
    options: [
      { letter: 'A', text: 'Generate quote → Reserve funds → Convert → Send to destination → Update balances' },
      { letter: 'B', text: 'Check available balance → Reserve funds → Convert → Send to destination → Update balances' },
      { letter: 'C', text: 'Send payment instructions → Wait for funds → Convert → Send to destination' },
      { letter: 'D', text: 'Convert immediately → Check balance → Send to destination' }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: "Prefunded flows require checking available balance first, then reserving those funds, executing the conversion, sending to the external destination, and finally updating account balances. This ensures atomic operations and prevents double-spending.",
    category: 'technical'
  },
  {
    id: 13,
    question: "What is the primary technical difference between implementing ramps capability for 'all accounts' (*) versus specific account IDs in the capabilities response?",
    options: [
      { letter: 'A', text: 'No difference, just different notation' },
      { letter: 'B', text: 'Asterisk means all current accounts, specific IDs mean only future accounts' },
      { letter: 'C', text: 'Asterisk enables ramps for all accounts, specific IDs restrict ramps to only those accounts' },
      { letter: 'D', text: 'Asterisk is for main accounts only, specific IDs are for sub-accounts only' }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: "The capabilities response controls feature availability per account. Using '*' means RAMP operations are available for all accounts managed by the provider. Listing specific account IDs restricts RAMP functionality to only those accounts, requiring more granular access control logic.",
    category: 'technical'
  },
  {
    id: 14,
    question: "When handling participantsIdentification in RAMP transactions, what determines whether originator or beneficiary PII is required?",
    options: [
      { letter: 'A', text: 'Always require both originator and beneficiary details' },
      { letter: 'B', text: 'Transaction amount determines requirements' },
      { letter: 'C', text: 'First-party vs third-party ownership and regulatory requirements determine PII needs' },
      { letter: 'D', text: 'Only beneficiary information is ever required' }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: "PII requirements depend on transaction ownership patterns and regulatory compliance. First-party transactions (same entity) may require less PII since parties are pre-KYC'd. Third-party transactions need full originator and beneficiary details for Travel Rule compliance and AML reporting.",
    category: 'compliance'
  },
  {
    id: 15,
    question: "In a RAMP implementation supporting multiple blockchains, how should asset references be structured to handle the same token across different networks?",
    options: [
      { letter: 'A', text: 'Use the same assetId for identical tokens regardless of blockchain' },
      { letter: 'B', text: 'Create unique assetIds for each blockchain-token combination with blockchain specified in asset definition' },
      { letter: 'C', text: 'Use cryptocurrencySymbol only, ignore blockchain differences' },
      { letter: 'D', text: 'Always use contractAddress regardless of blockchain' }
    ],
    correctAnswer: 'B',
    explanation: "Each blockchain-token combination requires a unique assetId since the same token (e.g., USDC) on different blockchains (Ethereum vs Polygon) represents different technical assets with different contract addresses, network fees, and settlement characteristics. The asset definition must specify the blockchain for proper handling.",
